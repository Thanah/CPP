   - Use functions for each operation and ensure proper error handling (e.g., divide by zero).

#### 2. **File Reader and Writer**
   - Create a program that reads data from a text file, processes it (e.g., counting words or finding keywords), and writes the results to a new file.
   - Practice working with file streams (`fstream`).

#### 3. **Simple Banking System**
   - Simulate a basic banking system with features like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
   - Store account information in a file or an in-memory data structure like a map.

   - Include features like CPU burst time simulation and process queues.

#### 13. **Network Packet Sniffer**
   - Develop a program that captures and analyzes network packets using libraries like `libpcap`.
   - Demonstrate knowledge of network protocols and low-level programming.

#### 14. **Custom Shell**
   - Create a basic shell that can execute commands, handle I/O redirection, and support piping.
   - Focus on system calls and process management in C++.

#### 15. **Real-Time Systems Project**
   - Design a real-time task scheduler that manages periodic tasks.
   - Demonstrate deterministic scheduling and integrate it with real-world scenarios (e.g., controlling sensors or motors in a simulation).

#### 16. **Simulation of a Radar System**
   - Build a radar-like simulation that tracks objects on a 2D plane.
   - Use multithreading for real-time tracking and implement basic signal processing concepts.
